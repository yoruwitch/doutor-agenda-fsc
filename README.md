# 🩺 Doutor Agenda FSC

Welcome to **Doutor Agenda FSC**! 🚀  
This is an amazing study project from [Full Stack Club](https://fullstack.club), guided by [Felipe Rocha](https://github.com/felipemotarocha). 👨‍🏫

> I'm currently developing this project as part of my learning journey. There are so many new technologies and concepts I haven't mastered yet, but I'm fully committed to learning and growing every day! 💪✨

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **Next.js** ([Docs](https://nextjs.org)) — Modern React framework
- **React** — UI library for building interactive interfaces
- **Drizzle** — Type-safe ORM for SQL databases
- **PostgreSQL** — Powerful open-source relational database

## Diagram for the database

- It was made using [Eraser](https://www.eraser.io/), using my `schema.ts` file as prompt to generate this diagram.

## 🌱 Why this project?

This project is a hands-on opportunity to dive deep into full stack development, exploring new tools and best practices. I'm excited to share my progress and discoveries along the way!

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.
